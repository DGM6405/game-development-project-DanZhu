The Tomb Guardian

In ancient China, emperors often built their graves to be very luxurious, to show the imperial power. But expensive funerary objects attracted many robbers. Therefore, the emperors tried every means to defend themselves and the tombs of the clan: the establishment of organs, the placement of fake coffins, the use of statues of the generals, and so on. As the times went by, various novel institutions were slowly invented. Until modern times, people began to use various high-tech means to protect the emperor's tomb.
In The Tomb Guardian, you will become the designer of the emperor's tomb, and you can use various props to protect the emperor's tomb. You will begin with the dynasty three thousand years ago, with the most primitive props to arrange the mausoleum of the emperor; over time, you will get new props from the robbers, and new invents invented by the inventor to re-arrange your grave.
Before each level is opened, you need to arrange your graves first. Once placed, the placed items will not be able to change. However, the attacking tomb stalker will drop some special items, you can pick up and use these special items to enhance your defense until the end of the level.
Item type:
1. Defense tower:
Statues of the generals: Different levels will unlock different statues of the generals, and the statues can summon the general undead to guard the imperial tomb. The general undead has a certain patrol range. Each general has his own special attack range, attack methods and skills.
Terracotta Warriors: Terracotta Warriors are divided into different arms, they can summon ordinary undead. Ordinary undead do not have the skills and cannot patrol, they can only defend at their own fixed position.
